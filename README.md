# 🧠 StudyBuzz – Real-Time Drowsiness and Yawning Detection System

StudyBuzz is a real-time computer vision tool that monitors eye and mouth movements to detect signs of drowsiness and yawning using your webcam. Designed with students in mind, it provides instant voice alerts to help you stay focused while studying.

## 🔍 Features

- 👁️ Detects **eye closure** using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- 😮 Detects **yawning** using Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
- 🔊 Real-time **text-to-speech alerts**
- 🧠 Works entirely **offline** using `pyttsx3`
- ⏳ Includes a **cooldown timer** to avoid repeated alerts
- ⚙️ Built with `MediaPipe`, `OpenCV`, and `Python`

## 📸 How It Works

Webcam Input → MediaPipe FaceMesh → EAR & MAR Calculation → Condition Check → Text-to-Speech Alert

- EAR < 0.25 (for 2 seconds) → "Eyes closed! Wake up!"
- MAR > 0.03 → "You are yawning. Stay awake!"
